## Step 0: Set up

In this step, you download Dart and get the sample code.


### Get Dart.

If you havenâ€™t already done so, get the Dart download
by clicking the big **Download Dart + Editor**
button on the Dart homepage.

> **<a href="http://www.dartlang.org" target="_blank">Download Dart + Editor</a>**

Unzip the ZIP file, which creates a directory called `dart`.


### Start the editor.

Go to the `dart` directory and double-click **DartEditor**.

**Got questions? Having trouble?** Go to the
[Troubleshooting Dart Editor](https://www.dartlang.org/tools/editor/troubleshoot.html) page.


###  Get the sample code.

[Download the sample code.](https://github.com/angular/ng-darrrt-codelab/archive/master.zip)
{**NO, WAIT, DON'T! [PENDING]:**
Until the revamp branch becomes the master branch, download this instead:
https://github.com/angular/ng-darrrt-codelab/archive/revamp.zip}

Unzip the ZIP file,
which creates a directory called `ng-darrrt-codelab-master`.
{**Note [PENDING]:**
Until the revamp branch becomes the master branch,
the directory is `ng-darrrt-codelab-revamp`, not `ng-darrrt-codelab-master`.}
