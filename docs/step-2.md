## Step 2: Add an input field

In this step, you add an input field
that updates the text of the badge.

_**Keywords**: binding, scope, model_

-----------------------------
> **Note**: Throughout this code lab, continue to edit the files in `s1_basics`.
You can use the files in the other `samples` subdirectories to compare to your code
or to recover if you get off track.

-----------------------------

### Edit main.dart.

&rarr; Add the following imports just above main()).

<pre>
<b>import 'package:angular/angular.dart';

@MirrorsUsed(override: '*')
import 'dart:mirrors';</b>

void main() {
...
</pre>

Key information:

* An import pulls in a Dart library.
* Importing `dart:mirrors` and annotating it with `@MirrorsUsed` is a temporary
  measure that can help the dart2js compiler to generate smaller code.

---

&rarr; Add `ngBootstrap();` to the `main`() method:

<pre>
void main() {
<b>  ngBootstrap();</b>
}
</pre>

Key information:
* Once an application is bootstrapped, itâ€™s ready to respond to incoming browser events
  (such as mouse clicks, key presses, or incoming HTTP responses)
  that might change the data that the app displays.


### Edit piratebadge.html.

&rarr; Add an `ng-app` attribute to the `<html>` element:

<pre>
&lt;html <b>ng-app</b>>
</pre>

Key information:

* The `ng-app` attribute is a _Angular directive_
  that identifies the root element of the application.
  Anything inside of the root element is part of the page template managed by Angular.
  Unless you have a reason for Angular to manage only part of the app,
  we recommend putting the `ng-app` directive on the `<html>` element because it is the outermost tag.

---

&rarr; Add a `<div>` containing an `<input>` element to the "widgets" `<div>`.

<pre>
...
&lt;div class="widgets">
<b>  &lt;div>
    &lt;input type="text" id="inputName" maxlength="15" ng-model="name">
  &lt;/div></b>
&lt;/div>
...
</pre>

Key information:
* The `ng-model` directive binds the input's value attribute to the property `name`.
* Angular creates the `name` property if it doesn't already exist (which it doesn't, in this case).

---

&rarr; Insert `{{name}}` in the "badgeName" span, and add an `ng-cloak` directive to hide it.

<pre>
&lt;span id="badgeName" <b>ng-cloak</b>><b>{{name}}</b>&lt;/span>
</pre>

Key information:
* Angular uses double curly braces  `{{...}}`, also known as double-mustache syntax,
  to contain Angular expressions. 
  Angular evaluates the expression and puts the result in the DOM.
* Angular swaps out `{{name}}` and substitutes the value of the `name` property.
* If you don't use `ng-cloak` and related CSS,
  Angular expressions such as `{{name}}` will be visible in your app until Angular swaps them out.

### Run the app.

&rarr; Like before, right-click `web/index.html`, and choose **Run in Dartium**.

&rarr; Type into the text field that appears.

Notice how the view (the badge) updates in real time whenever
the model (the contents of the text field) changes.
This is called _two-way data binding_.
Angular listens for changes to the model and updates the view to reflect those changes.
